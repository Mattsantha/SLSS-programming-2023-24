# Headings
We create heading in Markdown using hash (#) symbols
To create subheading, we can use multiple has symbols 

## This is a level 2 subheading 
### This is a level 3 subheading
###### This is a level 6 sub heading (Max lvl)
# Modifying Text Style 
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically bold and italics 
e.g.
I want this  **word**  specifically to be bold
I want this  *word* specifically to be italicized 
I want this  ***word***  specifically to be bold and italicized

## Escape Characters
ASIDE: If we want to place a character that isa keyword or reserved word, and we want the LITERAL character, use the forward slash (\\)
		e.g. if we want to put an asterisk, we do this \\\*

## Strikethrough
We can also strikethrough character using tilde (~)
I want to strikethrough a specific ~~word
This sentence is struckthrough~~

## Links
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use.](https://chat.openai.com) 
Exercise:
* if you have an openai account, do the following:
	* ask chatgpt to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice
* if you don't have chatgpt/openai, create two links to websites of your choice in the space below

e.g. [My favourite website right now](http://aniwatch.to)
e.g. if you use openai
Put in their code, and in italics say that it's from chatgpt
[A search engine]([https://google.com](https://google.com/)) *from chatgpt*

[Best anime website](http://aniwatch.to)
[Best manhwa website](https://asuracomics.com)

# Images
### Method 1
e.g.
![Cheetah](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fencrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com%2Flicensed-image%3Fq%3Dtbn%3AANd9GcSJOLYNRYiStt_yuOskGOSicX4ICp3_BIO3qfz7QU1xZ6h6j3ycM9EHrReY3ntjABrCFJDCcwzpfReY4io&psig=AOvVaw0uRXUE9hiHyE0Go-g3HMAC&ust=1694277755021000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIj92s-6m4EDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)


# Method Two Doesn't Work

# Blockquotes 
Blockquoes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text.
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes.

> This is an example of a blockquote
> This is line two of the blockquote
> 
> This is the fourth line; the third is blank

# Lists
We can create both ordered and unordered lists

# Unordered Lists
To create each point, we use (\*) with a space behind it
We can create sublists by placing TABS before the asterisk. 
e.g.
* dairy
	* eggs
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice

# Ordered Lists
If there is a specified order to the elements in our list,
we create ordered lists
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

e.g/
1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift to get the second line*)
	 Add both regular and brown sugar 
1. Use the mixer to cream the butter and sugar together 

# Tables
We can organize information in tables using markdown
We use dashes (-) and pipes(|) 

Tables in Mardown require headings

e.g.

| Name      | Age     | Sign     | SuperPower  |
| ---           | ---      | ---        |---          | 
| Bruce Wayne | 35     | Aquarius | Intelligence/$ |
| Matt Santha | 17     | Taurus   | Kevin killer |
| Kevin Wong  | 5      | idk      | Hemroids |
