Models are bits of code that we can use in python 
These bits of code aren't automatically included, 
so we need to import them in our code

# Import
The import keyword loads the module into our file
imports should **be at the top of the file** under the **header**

# The time module
Time allows us to play around with anything related to time
We can pause our code using time

```python
import time

# Pause code for 1 second
time.sleep(1)
```
