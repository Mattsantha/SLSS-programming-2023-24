# Natural Language Processing

## Output
we can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen 
We use the print)() function to display output

```python
print("Your text goes in here")
```


	Task
	1. open Visual Stidio Code
	2. make sure that its open to yuor reposoitory 
	3. create a new file caleed iput_and_output.py

## [[Headers]]

## Comments
comments are pieces of text that are not interpreted by Python.
This means that the text is ignored;.
We use the # symbol to make comments.

```python
# this is a comment
```

	Task
	1. In 'onput and output.py1'
	2. Put the header
	3. Write in some comments

# Input
we can grab information from the user using input ().
When we run the function, it does two things: 
1. It waits for the user to write something or nothing
2. The user presses **Enter/Return** to indicate that they are finished 

```python
input(

input(<prompt>).  # prints out the prompt then wait
)
```

## Variables 
Variables allow us to store information for the time that our app is running

```python
favorite_food = input("What is your favorite food")
```

Favorite_food -> name of the variables
= -> assignment operator
input... -> value

# Naming
What you can do:
1. name them with letters, umbers, underscore
2. names **should** start with a lowercase letter
What you can't do:
1. you **Can't** name them with spaces or symbols
2. you **can't** name them with certain names that are reserved
	1. e.g. if, while, for, and, or,. ....

A good name is something like this:
```python
favorite_food
fave_food
date_of_birth
student_number
```

Bad names are like this
```python
Favorite_food
a
num
aa
aaa
aaaa
```
